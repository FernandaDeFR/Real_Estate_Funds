# üìä Real Estate Funds (FIIs) Data Analysis Toolkit

## üöÄ Overview

This repository hosts a set of **Python scripts** designed for data analysis, calculation, and reporting on Brazilian Real Estate Investment Funds (FIIs) traded on the B3.

The primary goal of this project is to automate the analysis of FII performance indicators, dividend yields, and price data, transforming raw financial information into actionable investment metrics.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Data Processing:** Python script to handle and clean large datasets containing historical data for FIIs.
* **Metric Calculation:** Calculates essential financial metrics, including dividend yield, P/VP (Price to Book Value), and historical price variations.
* **Filtering Capability:** Implements functions to filter FIIs based on user-defined criteria (e.g., minimum liquidity, target dividend yield, specific sector).
* **Summary Reporting:** Generates structured reports and data summaries for quick evaluation of multiple funds.
* **Visualization:** Uses data visualization libraries to plot trends and compare performance over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements and Setup

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/FernandaDeFR/Real_Estate_Funds.git](https://github.com/FernandaDeFR/Real_Estate_Funds.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Real_Estate_Funds
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib [any-other-library-you-use]
    ```
    *(**Note:** Replace `[any-other-library-you-use]` with any other specific library, like `requests` or `scipy`, if needed.)*

## üí° How to Run the Analysis

1.  **Data Source:** Ensure your raw data (e.g., a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file containing FII information) is placed in the project root directory (or a specified `/data` folder).
2.  **Execute the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main_analysis.py
    ```
    *(**Note:** Replace `main_analysis.py` with the actual name of your primary Python script.)*
3.  **Output:** The script will output the processed data and generated reports (e.g., `.csv` files or visualizations) to the designated output folder.
